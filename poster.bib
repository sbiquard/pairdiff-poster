  abstract      = {Forthcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarized anisotropy experiments have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe and fundamental physics. The sought-after, tale-telling signatures will be however distributed over voluminous data sets which these experiments will collect. These data sets will need to be efficiently processed and unwanted contributions due to astrophysical, environmental, and instrumental effects characterized and efficiently mitigated in order to uncover the signatures. This poses a significant challenge to data analysis methods, techniques, and software tools which will not only have to be able to cope with huge volumes of data but to do so with unprecedented precision driven by the demanding science goals posed for the new experiments.},

  abstractnote = {Analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) datasets typically requires some ﬁltering of the raw time-ordered data. For instance, in the context of ground-based observations, ﬁltering is frequently used to minimize the impact of low frequency noise, atmospheric contributions and/or scan synchronous signals on the resulting maps. In this work we have explicitly constructed a general ﬁltering operator, which can unambiguously remove any set of unwanted modes in the data, and then amend the map-making procedure in order to incorporate and correct for it. We show that such an approach is mathematically equivalent to the solution of a problem in which the sky signal and unwanted modes are estimated simultaneously and the latter are marginalized over. We investigated the conditions under which this amended map-making procedure can render an unbiased estimate of the sky signal in realistic circumstances. We then discuss the potential implications of these observations on the choice of map-making and power spectrum estimation approaches in the context of B-mode polarization studies. Speciﬁcally, we have studied the eﬀects of time-domain ﬁltering on the noise correlation structure in the map domain, as well as impact it may have on the performance of the popular pseudospectrum estimators. We conclude that although maps produced by the proposed estimators arguably provide the most faithful representation of the sky possible given the data, they may not straightforwardly lead to the best constraints on the power spectra of the underlying sky signal and special care may need to be taken to ensure this is the case. By contrast, simpliﬁed map-makers which do not explicitly correct for time-domain ﬁltering, but leave it to subsequent steps in the data analysis, may perform equally well and be easier and faster to implement. We focused on polarization-sensitive measurements targeting the B-mode component of the CMB signal and apply the proposed methods to realistic simulations based on characteristics of an actual CMB polarization experiment, POLARBEAR. Our analysis and conclusions are however more generally applicable.},

  abstractnote = {We report on the design and performance of the BICEP2 instrument and on its three-year data set. BICEP2 was designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on angular scales of 1 to 5 degrees ( = 40–200), near the expected peak of the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inﬂation. Measuring B-modes requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control of systematics. The BICEP2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26 cm aperture and cold, on-axis, refractive optics. BICEP2 also adopted a new detector design in which beam-deﬁning slot antenna arrays couple to transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers, all fabricated on a common substrate. The antenna-coupled TES detectors supported scalable fabrication and multiplexed readout that allowed BICEP2 to achieve a high detector count of 500 bolometers at 150 GHz, giving unprecedented sensitivity to B-modes at degree angular scales. After optimizatio√n of detector and readout parameters, BICEP2 achieved an instrument noise-equivalent temperature of 15.8 µK s. The full data set reached Stokes Q and U map depths of 87.2 nK in square-degree pixels (5.2 µK · arcmin) over an effective area of 384 square degrees within a 1000 square degree ﬁeld. These are the deepest CMB polarization maps at degree angular scales to date. The power spectrum analysis presented in a companion paper has resulted in a signiﬁcant detection of B-mode polarization at degree scales.},

  abstractnote = {This paper presents the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) data processing procedures for the <i>Planck<i/> 2018 release. Major improvements in mapmaking have been achieved since the previous <i>Planck<i/> 2015 release, many of which were used and described already in an intermediate paper dedicated to the <i>Planck<i/> polarized data at low multipoles. These improvements enabled the first significant measurement of the reionization optical depth parameter using <i>Planck<i/>-HFI data. This paper presents an extensive analysis of systematic effects, including the use of end-to-end simulations to facilitate their removal and characterize the residuals. The polarized data, which presented a number of known problems in the 2015 <i>Planck<i/> release, are very significantly improved, especially the leakage from intensity to polarization. Calibration, based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, is now extremely accurate and in the frequency range 100–353 GHz reduces intensity-to-polarization leakage caused by calibration mismatch. The Solar dipole direction has been determined in the three lowest HFI frequency channels to within one arc minute, and its amplitude has an absolute uncertainty smaller than 0.35 <i>μ<i/>K, an accuracy of order 10<sup>−4<sup/>. This is a major legacy from the <i>Planck<i/> HFI for future CMB experiments. The removal of bandpass leakage has been improved for the main high-frequency foregrounds by extracting the bandpass-mismatch coefficients for each detector as part of the mapmaking process; these values in turn improve the intensity maps. This is a major change in the philosophy of “frequency maps”, which are now computed from single detector data, all adjusted to the same average bandpass response for the main foregrounds. End-to-end simulations have been shown to reproduce very well the relative gain calibration of detectors, as well as drifts within a frequency induced by the residuals of the main systematic effect (analogue-to-digital convertor non-linearity residuals). Using these simulations, we have been able to measure and correct the small frequency calibration bias induced by this systematic effect at the 10<sup>−4<sup/> level. There is no detectable sign of a residual calibration bias between the first and second acoustic peaks in the CMB channels, at the 10<sup>−3<sup/> level.},
